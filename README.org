#+TITLE: Value-Per-Acre Mapper

** 0. Setup

Be sure you have installed:
- [[https://gdal.org/][GDAL]]
- [[https://www.r-project.org/][R]]

** 1. Find your Data

This may take some time. You can typically find the best results
searching
~<City/County> GIS Open Data Portal~ or
~<City/County> Taxlots Data~.

Ideally you are able to find an online map that is backed by an ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Feature Server that hosts this data.

Here's an example of the page you're looking for: [[https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=901cdd4a5ca24cc3b72cc8e3e0f11f02][Bend Count Taxlots]]. You will want to take note of the URL ending in `/FeatureServer`.

** 2. Bring it into R

*** Value-Per-Acre in R
#+BEGIN_SRC R :tangle vpa.R
  library(httr)
  library(sf)
  library(units)
  library(dplyr)
  library(leaflet)

  ## Get Taxlots Geometry
  url <- parse_url("https://services1.arcgis.com/znO8Hz1SuVVohYhZ/arcgis/rest/services/Taxlots/FeatureServer/0/query")
  url$query <- list(where = "1=1",
		    outFields = "*",
		    returnGeometry = "true",
		    f = "geojson")
  request <- build_url(url)

  taxlots_wgs84 <- st_read(request)

  ## Calculate Area
  taxlots <- st_transform(taxlots_wgs84, crs=2992)
  taxlots$area <- units::set_units(st_area(taxlots), "acres")
  taxlots <- rename(taxlots, Taxlot = TAXLOT)
  taxlots <- taxlots[, c("Taxlot", "PARCEL", "area")]

  ## Get Taxlots Value
  url <- parse_url("https://services1.arcgis.com/znO8Hz1SuVVohYhZ/arcgis/rest/services/Taxlots/FeatureServer/7/query")
  url$query <- list(where = "1=1",
		    outFields = "*",
		    f = "pgeojson")
  request <- build_url(url)

  assessed_value <- st_read(request)
  assessed_value <- st_drop_geometry(assessed_value)

  ## Merge
  taxlots <- merge(taxlots, assessed_value[, c("Taxlot", "RMV_Land", "RMV_Impr", "RMV_Total", "AV_Total")], by="Taxlot")
  taxlots$vpa <- taxlots$AV_Total / taxlots$area
  taxlots$vpa <- drop_units(taxlots$vpa)

  ## Write to GeoPackage
  taxlots <- st_transform(taxlots, crs=4326)
  st_write(taxlots, "bend-vpa.gpkg")

  ## Write to MBTiles
  st_write(taxlots, "bend-vpa.mbtiles")

  ## Convert to PMTiles
  system("pmtiles convert bend-vpa.mbtiles bend-vpa.pmtiles")
